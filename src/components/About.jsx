        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I was born in Oxford, England and grew up in Athens, Greece. I am bi-cultural and bilingual. I attended an international school where from a young age, I was exposed to a plethora of cultures and am therefore able to appreciate the importance of culture in my line of work. I have been a registered psychologist since 2013. I was awarded my Bsc Psychology/Sociology from the University of Surrey, Roehampton in London. Following that, I completed my postgraduate degree in Health Psychology at the University of Stirling in Scotland. Currently, I am undergoing training as a systemic psychotherapist at Logos Psychis- the Training and Research Institute for Systemic Psychotherapy.  I am being trained in the S.A.N.E. (System, Attachment, Narrative, Encephalon) model, pioneered by its founding members and am bound by the Instituteâ€™s code of ethical conduct. 
        Furthermore, I am a certified Hatha, Vinyasa, Aerial and Yin yoga teacher and I use an assortment of techniques from these kinds of yoga when dealing with symptoms caused by anxiety, depression, panic attacks and PTSD. I also use them to help build self-confidence and self-trust. 
        I have attended numerous seminars and have worked for the Council of Glyfada as well as in various shelters that house vulnerable populations.
        I offer sessions to adolescents and adults 
        as well as couple and family therapy. Sessions last 50 mins and are conducted weekly or fortnightly in either English or Greek.</p>
